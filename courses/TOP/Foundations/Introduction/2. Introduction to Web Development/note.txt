What Web Developers Do
Build and maintain websites by turning client needs (tech firms, startups, or organizations) into functional applications.

Roles include front-end (HTML, CSS, JS for UI), back-end (server-side logic & databases), or full-stack (both) 


Web dev is a logical, creative, and in-demand profession with solid pay and lifestyle balance 

💼 Front-End, Back-End & Full-Stack
Front-end: Deals with UI—design, layouts, interaction via HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

Back-end: Handles server logic, databases, scalability with languages like Python, Ruby, JS.

Full-stack: Combines both, which TOP aims to teach

Big Tech: High standards, premium pay.
