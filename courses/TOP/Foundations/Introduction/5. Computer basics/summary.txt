# Summary: Computer Basics 

This lesson introduces fundamental computer concepts, hardware and software components, operating systems, applications, and safe practices.

## 1. What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device that processes, stores, and retrieves data. Examples include:
- Desktops, laptops
- Smartphones and tablets
- Wearables like smartwatches

Computers consist of:
- **Hardware**: Physical parts like CPU, keyboard, mouse, screen, fan, etc.
- **Software**: Programs or instructions that tell hardware what to do.

## 2. Operating Systems (OS)
An OS is the most important software on a computer. It:
- Manages memory, hardware, files, and software
- Provides an interface between users and hardware

Examples:
- **Windows** (common in personal computers)
- **macOS** (Apple computers)
- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **iOS / Android** (mobile devices)

## 3. Applications
Applications (apps) are programs designed to help users perform specific tasks:
- Media players (e.g., Spotify)
- Office software (e.g., Word, Excel)
- Web browsers, games, code editors, etc.

Apps depend on the OS and run on top of it.

## 4. Open Source vs Closed Source Software
- **Open-source** software:
  - Source code is publicly available.
  - Users can view, modify, and share it.
  - Examples: Linux, LibreOffice
  - Pros: Freedom, transparency, often free
  - Cons: May be unstable or less user-friendly in obscure projects

- **Closed-source** software:
  - Source code is hidden and proprietary.
  - Maintained solely by the organization.
  - Examples: Microsoft Word, macOS
  - Pros: Polished and stable
  - Cons: Less control, more expensive, slower bug fixes (unless supported)

## 5. Taking Screenshots
Screenshots are images captured of your screen. Use cases include:
- Saving important visual info (e.g., receipts)
- Reporting bugs or error messages
- Sharing content quickly
- Creating tutorials

## 6. Password Tips
A strong password should:
- Be long and unpredictable
- Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Avoid using personal info or common words

Example:
- Weak: `OdinProject`
- Strong: `aufh8r_BLy7jU`
