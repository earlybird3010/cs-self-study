The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake using W, A, S, and D keys. 
The snake moves around the screen eating fruits to grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

Part 1: Game Design
Snake:

- Represented by array of (x,y) coords.

- Movement: head moves in latest direction; body follows.

- Eating: grows one segment if head overlaps fruit.

- Collision: game ends if head hits wall or body.

Fruit

- Single (x,y) coord.

- Appears if none on screen or previous eaten.

- Must not overlap snake.

Maze

- Use 2D array maze[rows][cols]

- 0 = empty, 1 = wall, 2 = snake, 3 = fruit.

Gameplay Loop (per frame)

- Check collisions.

- Render all sprites.

- Take input ‚Üí set direction.

Development Phases

- Phase 1: Greeting message.

- Phase 2: Core logic (maze, snake, fruit).

- Phase 3: Smooth gameplay with ncurses.

Part 2: C Lessons
Phase 1 (Prompt)

- Arrays decay into pointers when passed to functions.

- Initializing an array = pointer to first element + fixed size.

- Takeaway: Functions don‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù array size, only pointer.

Phase 2 (Core Logic)

- scanf("%c", &c) ‚Üí doesn‚Äôt skip whitespace, stops on \n, doesn‚Äôt include it.

- fgets(buf, size, stream) ‚Üí reads up to size-1, includes \n if present, always null terminates.

- Takeaway: prefer fgets for predictable input.

Phase 3 (Smooth gameplay)

- ncurses = terminal-independent screen + input handling.

- WINDOW holds internal image.

- curscr: current screen.

- stdscr: your working screen.

- Call refresh() to display changes.

- Takeaway: keep game logic separate from UI ‚Üí easier to maintain.

üëÄ Game Design Observation
To design any simple game, think in terms of:

Sprite Representation: What does the game entity look like (e.g., snake, fruit)?

Sprite Actions: How can it behave or move (e.g., snake slithers, fruit sits idle)?

State Changes: What happens as a result of actions (e.g., snake grows when it eats a fruit)?
