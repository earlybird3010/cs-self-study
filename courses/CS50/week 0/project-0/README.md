# Triwizard Maze
Triwizard Maze is a maze escape game based on the third task in the Triwizard Tournament in the book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

# Why?
I want to create a substantial Scratch project to improve my critical thingking and debugging skills.

# Phase 1: Basic setup
- [x] **Basic Setup:** Create a maze sprite, a Harry Potter Sprite, and a Triwizard Cup sprite at the center of the maze.
- [x] **Player Movement:** Implement function to represent Harry Potter's natural movement. It means the player cannot pass through walls.
- [x] **Goal Object:** The game ends when Harry Potter touches the Triwizard cup.

## Additional details
- Changed the maze from a backdrop to a sprite to utilize the `touching` sensing block. This ensure the player cannot pass through walls.
- Added an additional backdrop and sprite that appear when the player reaches the Triwizard Cup, serving as a win screen.

# Phase 2
