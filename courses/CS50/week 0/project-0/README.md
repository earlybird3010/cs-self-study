# Triwizard Maze
Triwizard Maze is a maze escape game based on the third task in the Triwizard Tournament in the book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

# Why?
I want to create a substantial Scratch project to improve my critical thingking and debugging skills.

# Phase 1
    - [] **Basic Setup:** Create a maze backdrop, a Harry Potter Sprite, and a Triwizard Cup sprite at the center of the maze.
    - [] **Player Movement:** Implement function to represent Harry Potter's natural movement. It means the player cannot pass through walls.
    - [] **Goal Object:** The game ends when Harry Potter touches the Triwizard cup.
