- printf strange behavior: %f means that the place can be replaced by the strings of both float and double.
- Implementation: both float and double are promoted to double upon being passed to printf 
- Same for int and char

- The factor that decides a value's type at a specific place are the % specification
conversion in the format string. As a result, if you provide a mismatch value; for example,
4 for %f, the printf functions attempts to read 8 bytes to get the corresponding value, but 
since 4 is only 4 bytes in storage, an error will occur.

- What happens without promotion?
Don't know.
