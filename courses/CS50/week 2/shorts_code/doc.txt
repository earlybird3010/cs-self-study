Functions are useful because:
- Better organization and structure:
a big problem is solved by many subproblems
- Simpler: a function that aims to solve a step
of a big problem is easier to design, implement, and 
debug
- DRY: we can use a function any time we want once it has 
beed defined
- Declarations: return_tpe name(argument_list);
